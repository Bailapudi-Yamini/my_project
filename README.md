Historically, farmers have relied on experience and advice  from fellow farmers, but this traditional approach fails to  ensure successful crop growth leading to potential income  losses.
To meet the food demands of any nation, it is imperative to  transform traditional farming methods, which typically do  not provide precise information.
To meet the food demands of any nation, it is imperative to transform traditional farming methods, which typically do not provide precise information.
Our study has identified three major problems in conventional agriculture: 
• Selecting suitable crops to maximize yield and profit 
• Choosing fertilizers based on crop and soil conditions with precise proportions 
• Identifying crop diseases and prescribing appropriate treatments

Purpose of the Project:
The Multi-Criteria Agriculture Recommendation System using Machine Learing for crop and fertilizer prediction is designed to aid farmers in making informed decisions about crop and fertilizer selection. Using machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes multiple factors—such as soil quality, weather conditions, and crop history—to provide personalized recommendations that maximize yield and efficiency.

How to Use It:
Set Up: Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine.

Install Dependencies: Use the command pip install -r requirements.txt to install necessary libraries.

Input Data: Load your dataset into the system, ensuring it includes all relevant parameters like soil pH, rainfall, temperature, etc. (Crop_recommendation_data.csv)

Run the Model: Execute the main script (e.g., main.py) to run the recommendation engine.

View Recommendations: The system will generate and display the best crop and fertilizer options based on the input data.

Documentation: Check the docs folder for detailed user guides and examples.

Configuration: Adjust any settings in the config.json file to tailor the system to your specific requirements.
